The buttons use a variation of the primary color as well as the accent color. The primary color will be used for monetary transactions and the accent colors are there while were getting to know each other, essentially for while we are clicking through the website; leading up to a check out page:

- The ghost buttons are for linking to pages
- The light buttons are for the step before a page that a purchase is about to be made
- The regular buttons are for purchase transactions

"font-size" can be changed only to suit screen size changes.
