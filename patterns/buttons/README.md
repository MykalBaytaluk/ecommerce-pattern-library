The buttons use a variation of the primary color as well as the accent color. The primary color will be used for monetary transactions and the accent colors are there while were getting to know each other:

- The regular buttons are for linking to primary pages
- The light buttons are for secondary transactions
- The ghost buttons are for purchase transactions

"font-size" can be changed only to suit screen size changes.
