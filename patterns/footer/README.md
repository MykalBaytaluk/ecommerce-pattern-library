The footer is the main point of contact for our customers. It is understated and extremely optimized for mobile use. The footer is vital to every single page and must be used. Its code is written and structured for you to simply grab it in its entirety:

- footer needs to hold this structure because of how much information there is on it.
- The join button should lead to a quick confirmation message.

"font-size" is only changed when screen size changes.
