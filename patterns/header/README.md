The header is the first image that our customers see on any given page. It is understated and extremely optimized for mobile use.

- The header needs to hold this structure so that it can be uniform on every page.
- Text can be used in the header but has to be outside of/underneath the image to keep things clean.
- Images must have a similar filter style to the one already used.


"font-size" can be changed only to suit screen size changes.
