fonts:
  primary: |
    The primary typeface is to be used across the entire website to help keep readability consistent on every page. By using the same typeface throughout, we solidify our brand on yet another level.

    Use the primary typeface for body, headings, and everything else; use different weights.
colors:
  primary: |
    The primary color is to be used for headers and body copy because it is a strong blue that stands out against the white background.
  primary-light: |
    The primary light color will be used as a division of space to highlight secondary sections as well as actions of the website. It allows the primary color to stand out when on top of it.
  secondary: |
    The secondary color is to be used for buttons that have been clicked. It contrasts pleasantly with the primary color and adds a clear sign of action that has been taken.
  accent: |
    The accent color is to be used for anything that is underlined as well as shapes that are used to help things stand out. Because the background of the website is white, this color adds more excitement to the website while still being unified and clean.
